Hello. This is a little program for me to practice using a factory pattern.
I does not do anything except create some "Robots" and print their attributes.
I am fairly new to C++ so I am sure there are noob mistakes, such as memory
leaks. As I am using new allover the place and there is not one delete, nor
an implemented destructor.

If you would like to run just compile and run main.cpp.

ciao.
